You might read a lot. You follow the daily news. You follow the latest trends. You watch random youtube videos. But you don't feel like you learned a lot.

In Beaver Dam, you probably can't read a lot. But every day, we hope you'll get something new!

Learn about how to build a rocket, be amazed by a newly discovered species, or read a moving sci-fi story. All from the fellow beavers around you.

You get a new coin every day to read an article. Upvote to reward the author that coin, and share the article with others.
